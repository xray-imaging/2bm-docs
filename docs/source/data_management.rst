.. warning::

   **2026-08-14 — tomodata2 disk-array failure:** the ``/data2`` mount was
   totally lost. Everything on ``/data2`` that had **not** yet been mirrored
   to DM is permanently gone. Items on ``/data3`` and on DM were unaffected.
   Entries below tagged "**LOST**" refer to /data2 content that was not on DM
   at the time of failure. Detailed inventories: ``data2_backup_summary.pdf``
   (what was saved) and ``data2_lost_summary.pdf`` (what was lost) in
   ``/home/beams/2BMB/claude/dm/``.

This page summarizes the DM (APS Data Management) status for 2-BM datasets.

Convention: **Done** means the dataset was permanently moved from ``/local2/2BM``,
``/data2/2BM``, or ``/data3/2BM`` to ``/gdata/dm/2BM`` and the original copies were
deleted. **Pending** means the dataset still lives on one of the local disks and
has not yet been fully archived.

Shared staff/project backup — ``2026-08-ImagingStaff-0``
========================================================

Started **2026-08-18** to consolidate all non-beamline dirs on ``/data3`` (and
later ``/data2`` once IT clears it after the 2026-08-14 failure) into a single
yearly shared DM experiment. Purpose: provide DM archival for staff personal
workspaces (sboyer, vnikitin, etc.) and cross-cutting project dirs (ESRF,
Allen-NIH-\*, TMP_\*) that don't fit under a beamline GUP. **Yearly rollover:**
this experiment covers Aug–Dec 2026; a fresh ``2027-01-ImagingStaff-0`` will
be created in January.

.. note::

   **ACL widening.** ``2026-08-ImagingStaff-0`` grants read/write to all 9
   imaging group staff badges (Fezzaa, Kastengren, Shevchenko, Clark, Boyer,
   Mittone, Tang, Ekmekci, De Carlo). This is wider than the per-user rescue
   experiments (``2026-08-Nikitin-0``, ``2026-05-Boyer-0``) which will be
   retired once ImagingStaff verifies. Sarah and Viktor have been notified.

Execution: **two parallel streams**

- **Stream A (serial):** fresh rsyncs from ``/data3`` → ``ImagingStaff/data/data3/``
  for all live sources. One item at a time, ~350 MB/s per stream.
- **Stream B (side channel):** DM→DM copy of ``Nikitin-0/data/vnikitin_data2/`` →
  ``ImagingStaff/data/data2/vnikitin/`` (only surviving copy of the destroyed
  /data2/vnikitin workspace). Runs on a different NFS server than Stream A, no
  bandwidth contention, ~570 MB/s.

All rsyncs use ``rsync -rt --partial --info=progress2 --stats --chmod=Dg+w --exclude='.Trash-*'``.
The ``--chmod=Dg+w`` flag keeps new dirs group-writable so the ACL mask stays
``rwx`` and future delta rsyncs don't hit "mkstemp Permission denied" errors on
tight-mask subdirs.

Total transferred to ImagingStaff: **~170 T** across 5 parallel/sequential streams
over 2026-08-18 through 2026-08-23. Actual wall-clock exceeded initial estimates
because Viktor was actively writing to ``/data3/vnikitin`` throughout (see below).

Viktor Nikitin workspace reorganization
---------------------------------------

Between the ``2026-08-Nikitin-0`` rescue snapshot (2026-08-14) and the
ImagingStaff rsync (2026-08-22), Viktor made a major reorganization of
``/data3/vnikitin``:

- Top-level dirs went from **97** (in Nikitin-0) to **14** (current /data3)
- ~57 T of older content was deleted from /data3 (reconstructions,
  experimental variants, older ESRF / atomium runs, etc.)
- The active-work directory ``20260416/`` (25 subdirs) was ``mv``'d from
  ``/data3/vnikitin/20260416/`` to ``/data3/vnikitin/ESRF/20260416/``
- 5 new top-level dirs added: ``APS_IRI``, ``brain_dose_study``,
  ``dose_study``, ``holobrain_syn``, ``mosaic_brain``

**Consequence:** ``ImagingStaff/data/data3/vnikitin/`` holds a clean mirror
of the **current** /data3/vnikitin state (26.2 T, ~201 K files, verified).
The **pre-reorg** state — including the 57 T Viktor deleted — survives
**only** in ``2026-08-Nikitin-0/data/vnikitin_data3/`` (398 K files). For
this reason ``2026-08-Nikitin-0`` is **kept as historical archive** and is
**not** retired.

Notes
-----

- ``/data2`` has been rebuilt as RAID5 (was RAID0, lost in the 2026-08-14
  failure). Currently essentially empty; four top-level dirs seeded for the
  beamlines (``2BM``, ``7BM``, ``19BM``, ``32ID``). Once staff repopulate it,
  weekly rsyncs will pick up the new content into
  ``ImagingStaff/data/data2/``.
- ``2026-05-Boyer-0`` — verified 1:1 against ImagingStaff (59,741 files exact
  match on all three: /data3, Boyer-0, ImagingStaff). **Ready to retire** via
  dmadmin (not ``rm -rf`` on ``/gdata/dm/``, which would orphan DM metadata).
  Retirement will be triggered on demand.
- ``2026-08-Nikitin-0`` — **kept as historical archive** (see reorganization
  section above); sole surviving copy of the pre-Aug-22 /data3/vnikitin state.
  Small ACL preserved (Viktor + Francesco).
- Refresh cadence: **weekly weekend delta rsyncs** from ``/data2`` +
  ``/data3`` into the current year's experiment. Currently run **on demand**
  until the process is stable; automated cron to follow. No ``--delete`` — DM
  keeps history of anything users removed since last snapshot.
- Before deleting any ``/data3`` source, spot-check against the ImagingStaff
  destination using the pattern in ``/home/beams/2BMB/claude/dm/verify_all_subtrees.sh``
  (path+size 1:1 comparison via ``find | sort | comm``).
