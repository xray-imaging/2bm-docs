The sector 2 bending magnet beamline is fully dedicated to microtomography with capability to perform large field of view (20 x 2 mm :sup:`2`) fast 2D phase contrast imaging for slow dynamic phenomena studies (0.1m/s). The applications of this beamline range from life science, geoscience, physics, material science and engineering and paleontology. The flexibility of switching setups and capabilities of developing on-demand accessory experimental techniques make this beamline versatile in tomography applications.
