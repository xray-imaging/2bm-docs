The Tomo@0deg and Tomo@90deg motors are not responding (control screes is white)


These two motors are controlled by an EPICS softIOC. If the screen for Tomo@0deg and Tomo@90deg
are white it means that the softIOC was not started. To solve this please run::

    [user2bmb@arcturus]$ start_2bmS1.sh


or you can directly stop/start with::

    [user2bmb@arcturus]$ cd /net/s2dserv/xorApps/epics/synApps_5_8/ioc/2bmS1/iocBoot/ioc2bmS1Linux/
    [user2bmb@arcturus]$ ./2bmS1.sh start
    [user2bmb@arcturus]$ ./2bmS1.sh stop


.. warning:: Make sure you are in a cshell and not in a bash when running the above commands.

To start the 2bmS1 console::

    [user2bmb@arcturus]$ cd /net/s2dserv/xorApps/epics/synApps_5_8/ioc/2bmS1/iocBoot/ioc2bmS1Linux
    [user2bmb@arcturus]$ ../../bin/linux-x86_64/2bmS1 st.cmd
