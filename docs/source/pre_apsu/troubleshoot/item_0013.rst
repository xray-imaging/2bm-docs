Shutters
========

2-BM has two x-ray shutters: 

- Front End shutter upstream of 2-BM-A
- Mono shutter upstream of 2-BM-B

If you are not able to open the 2-BM-A or 2-BM-B shutters check the following:

- Shutter permit is enabled
- To open the B shutter: A and B stations are searched
- To open the A shutter: A station is searched

If you still cannot open the shutters check that the Equipment Protection System (EPS) is clear of errors. The EPS most frequent trips are caused by:

- Low He flow caused by low He pressure
- Vacuum bump casued by filter A moving with A shutter open
- Mirror high temperature caused by A slits too wide vertically or mirror to high in the beam
