The IOC runs directly on the MicroZed itself and starts automatically when booted.

Start the medm or caqtdm with:

::

   [2bmb@arcturus ~]$ cd /net/s2dserv/xorApps/epics/synApps_SG/ioc/2bmbMZ1/
   [2bmb@arcturus ~]$ ./start_epics_2bmbMZ1

or

::

   [2bmb@arcturus 2bmbMZ1]$ cd /net/s2dserv/xorApps/epics/synApps_SG/ioc/2bmbMZ1/
   [2bmb@arcturus 2bmbMZ1]$ ./start_caQtDM_2bmbMZ1 &

to get:

.. figure:: ../img/softglue_001.png
   :width: 360px
   :align: center
   :alt: softglue_001

   Softglue control

then select softGlue/softGlueZynqMenu to get:

.. figure:: ../img/softglue_002.png
   :width: 128px
   :align: center
   :alt: softglue_002

   Softglue control

then select Collections/all softGlueZynq

.. figure:: ../img/softglue_003.png

   Softglue control

The location of the pulses is configurable by python using the `write_pso_array <https://github.com/decarlof/interlaced/blob/main/macros_ILF.py>`_ function.

::


   (ops) 2bmb@arcturus]$ python
   Python 3.12.2 | packaged by conda-forge | (main, Feb 16 2024, 20:50:58) [GCC 12.3.0] on linux
   Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
   >>> import macros_ILF as m
   >>> m.write_PSO_array([0,2,4,6])
   >>> 


the list of positions [0,2,4,6] is in encoder pulses. 

The screen for the new component is found by going to softGlueZynqMenu -> Development -> memPulseSeq:

   New component

After the array is loaded in Python, setting memPulseSeq.enable = 1 arms the component. Once armed, the module will trigger on any subsequent PSO pulses it receives. Setting enable back to 0 returns the component to its unarmed (idle) state.

To allow either the raw PSO pulses or the interlaced sequence generated by the write_PSO_array() routine to drive the detector, we inserted a 2:1 multiplexer (MUX2-1). The MUX is configured with input0 = PSO and input1 = trigILF. By setting the MUX select process variable (PV) to 0 or 1, you can choose which signal is routed to the camera trigger.


To use the PSO:   

::

   [2bmb@arcturus]$ caput 2bmbMZ1:SG:MUX2-1_SEL_Signal 0 

To use the trigILF:

::

   [2bmb@arcturus]$ caput 2bmbMZ1:SG:MUX2-1_SEL_Signal 1
